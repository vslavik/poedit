              a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
=======

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale 
class reference.


 Installing
============

Binary easily-installable packages are provided for Windows and OS X and are
part of many Linux distributions.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of wxWidgets library, version >= 2.8.7
    (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)
  * Berkeley DB >= 4.7 if you need translation memory
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell 2.x plus GTK+ 2 build of wxWidgets for spell
    checking support


 Unix
------

Do the usual thing:
    ./configure
    make
    make install
This works on OS X (which is a standard BSD Unix system) and Windows with
MinGW toolchain and MSYS shell installed. You must have the dependencies
installed in a location configure will find, e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS appropriately.


 Mac OS X
----------

After compiling the application as above, you can additionally create an OS X
bundle by running "make bundle" in the src/ subdirectory. This requires that
GETTEXT_PREFIX environment variable is set and points to a directory with
compiled GNU gettext programs installed (e.g. msgfmt; GETTEXT_PREFIX=/opt/local
works if you used MacPorts to install gettext and so msgfmt is in
/opt/local/bin/msgfmt). Finally, running "make dist-osx" in the toplevel
directory will create disk image with the bundle.


 Windows using Visual Studio 2008 Express
------------------------------------------

Visual Studio makefile and project files are in win32/ directory; the project
is the primary supported way, but the makefile allows you to customize location
of 3rdparty software by setting variables documented near the top of the
makefile.

The simplest way of handling 3rd party dependencies is to get them from
http://github.com/vslavik/poedit-deps. Put that sources into the "deps"
directory. This is linked as submodule from the main Poedit repository;
see "Installing from Git repository" below.

Now go into the deps directory and run "ant" from command line. See deps/README
for information on what you need to do that.

You can also use Ant to build Poedit itself; run "ant -p" to see available
targets. This is the most convenient way of building full Poedit distribution;
it's how Poedit binaries are built.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

Get the sources from github (http://github.com/vslavik/poedit):

    git clone git://github.com/vslavik/poedit.git

If you are on Windows or OSX, you probably want the dependencies too. They
are at git://github.com/vslavik/poedit-deps.git, but as it's a git submodule,
you can get them by just doing

    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive

If you get the sources directly from the Git repository, some generated files
are not present. You have to run the ./bootstrap script to create them. After
that, continue according to the instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * Bakefile, to generate Windows makefiles/projects
 * ImageMagick and png2icns from libicns to generate icons in Windows and
   OS X native formats

If you don't have any of the dependencies, ./bootstrap will print errors, but
will continue to run. In other words, if you don't need e.g. Windows stuff, you
can ignore Windows-specific dependencies.

See the COPYING file for details on program's licensing and the
icons/README file for details on the icons.

Win32 and Mac OS X versions contain GNU gettext binaries. They are distributed
