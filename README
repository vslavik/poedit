              a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
=======

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale
class reference.


 Installing
============

Binary easily-installable packages are provided for Windows and OS X and are
part of many Linux distributions.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of wxWidgets library, version >= 3.0 (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)
  * ICU
  * LucenePlusPlus
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell for spell checking support

Optional dependencies:

  * cld2 (better language autodetection and non-English source languages)
  * Expat and Berkeley DB >= 4.7 (legacy translation memory migration)
  * C++REST SDK >= 2.5 (Crowdin integration)

 Ubuntu
--

Installing on Ubuntu requires the installation of a specific set of dependencies.

1. Install dependencies for building 
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential g++-4.8 g++ git make libboost1.54-all-dev libssl-dev cmake git libsecret-1-dev libgtkspell-dev
```
2. Create directory all required repositories 
```
cd ~; mkdir Source; cd Source
```
3. Download all required repositories
```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk.git
git clone https://github.com/luceneplusplus/LucenePlusPlus.git
git clone https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2
```
4. Download poedit source code
```
wget https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/releases/download/v1.8.6-oss/poedit-1.8.6.tar.gz
```
5. Extract it
```
tar -zxf poedit-1.8.6.tar.gz
```
6. Build and install LucenePlusPlus
```
cd ~/Source/LucenePlusPlus; mkdir build; cd build
CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make
sudo make install
```
7. Build and install REST SDK
```
cd ~/Source/cpprestsdk/Release; mkdir build; cd build
CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install
```
8. Install wxWidgets
```
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys http://repos.codelite.org/CodeLite.asc
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://repos.codelite.org/wx3.0.2/ubuntu/ trusty universe'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libwxbase3.0-0-unofficial libwxbase3.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-0-unofficial libwxgtk3.0-dev wx3.0-headers wx-common libwxbase3.0-dbg libwxgtk3.0-dbg wx3.0-i18n wx3.0-examples wx3.0-doc
```
9. Build and install poedit-1.8.6
```
cd ~/Source/poedit-1.8.6
./configure --disable-legacytm LDFLAGS="-L../cld2/internal/ " CPPFLAGS="-I.. "
make
sudo make install
```

You can now run `poedit` or launch it from your menu.

**Note**: If you receive the error 
```
poedit: error while loading shared libraries:
 liblucene++.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
You can fix this by running `echo "/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf
sudo ldconfig`

 Unix
------

Do the usual thing:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You must have the dependencies installed in a location configure will find,
e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS appropriately.


 OS X
------

You need a full git checkout to build on OS X; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.xcworkspace workspace and Xcode 6 to build
Poedit.

There are some additional dependencies on tools not included with OS X.
They can be installed with Homebrew and macosx/Brewfile:

    brew bundle macosx/


 Windows using Visual Studio 2013
----------------------------------

You need a full git checkout to build on Windows; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.sln solution.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

Get the sources from github (http://github.com/vslavik/poedit):

    git clone git://github.com/vslavik/poedit.git

If you are on Windows or OSX, you probably want the dependencies too. They
are at git://github.com/vslavik/poedit-deps.git, but as it's a git submodule,
you can get them by just doing

    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive

If you get the sources directly from the Git repository, some generated files
are not present. You have to run the ./bootstrap script to create them. After
that, continue according to the instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * Bakefile, to generate Windows makefiles/projects
 * ImageMagick and png2icns from libicns to generate icons in Windows and
   OS X native formats

If you don't have any of the dependencies, ./bootstrap will print errors, but
will continue to run. In other words, if you don't need e.g. Windows stuff, you
can ignore Windows-specific dependencies.
