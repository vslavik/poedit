              a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
=======

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale
class reference.


 Installing
============

Binary easily-installable packages are provided for Windows and OS X and are
part of many Linux distributions.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of wxWidgets library, version >= 3.0 (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)
  * ICU
  * LucenePlusPlus
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell for spell checking support

Optional dependencies:

  * cld2 (better language autodetection and non-English source languages)
  * Expat and Berkeley DB >= 4.7 (legacy translation memory migration)
  * C++REST SDK >= 2.5 (Crowdin integration)


 Unix
------

Do the usual thing:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You must have the dependencies installed in a location configure will find,
e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS appropriately.


 OS X
------

You need a full git checkout to build on OS X; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.xcworkspace workspace and Xcode 6 to build
Poedit.

There are some additional dependencies on tools not included with OS X.
They can be installed with Homebrew and macosx/Brewfile:

    brew bundle macosx/


 Windows using Visual Studio 2013
----------------------------------

You need a full git checkout to build on Windows; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.sln solution.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

Get the sources from github (http://github.com/vslavik/poedit):

    git clone git://github.com/vslavik/poedit.git

If you are on Windows or OSX, you probably want the dependencies too. They
are at git://github.com/vslavik/poedit-deps.git, but as it's a git submodule,
you can get them by just doing

    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive

If you get the sources directly from the Git repository, some generated files
are not present. You have to run the ./bootstrap script to create them. After
that, continue according to the instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * Bakefile, to generate Windows makefiles/projects
 * ImageMagick and png2icns from libicns to generate icons in Windows and
   OS X native formats

If you don't have any of the dependencies, ./bootstrap will print errors, but
will continue to run. In other words, if you don't need e.g. Windows stuff, you
can ignore Windows-specific dependencies.
