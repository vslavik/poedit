              a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
=======

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale
class reference.


 Installing
============

Binary easily-installable packages are provided for Windows and macOS and are
part of many Linux distributions.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of wxWidgets library, version >= 3.0.3 (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)
  * ICU
  * LucenePlusPlus
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell for spell checking support

Optional dependencies:

  * cld2 (better language autodetection and non-English source languages)
  * C++REST SDK >= 2.5 (Crowdin integration)


 Unix
------

Do the usual thing:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You must have the dependencies installed in a location configure will find,
e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS appropriately.


 macOS
-------

You need a full git checkout to build on macOS; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.xcworkspace workspace and Xcode 6 to build
Poedit.

There are some additional dependencies on tools not included with macOS.
They can be installed with Homebrew and macos/Brewfile:

    brew bundle macos/


 Windows using Visual Studio 2015
----------------------------------

You need a full git checkout to build on Windows; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.sln solution to build everything.

To build the installer, open win32/poedit.iss in Inno Setup and compile the
project.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

Get the sources from github (https://github.com/vslavik/poedit):

    git clone https://github.com/vslavik/poedit.git

If you are on Windows or OSX, you'll need all the dependencies too. After
closing, run the following command:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

On Linux and other Unices, only a subset of submodules is necessary, so you can
save some time and disk space by checking out only them:

    git submodule update --init src/json

When building for Unix/Linux, if you get the sources directly from the Git
repository, some generated files are not present. You have to run the
./bootstrap script to create them. After that, continue according to the
instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * gettext tools to create .mo files

On macOS and Windows, bootstrapping is not needed.


 License
=========

Poedit is released under the MIT license and you're free to do 
whatever you want with it and its source code (well, almost :-) -- see the
license text).

See the COPYING file for details on program's licensing and the
icons/README file for details on the icons.

Windows and macOS versions contain GNU gettext binaries. They are distributed
under the GNU General Public License and their source code is available from
