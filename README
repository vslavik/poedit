              a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool


 About
=======

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser. It helps
with translating application into another language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale
class reference.


 Installing
============

Binary easily-installable packages are provided for Windows and macOS and are
part of many Linux distributions.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of wxWidgets library, version >= 3.0.3 (see http://www.wxwidgets.org)
  * ICU
  * LucenePlusPlus
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell for spell checking support

Optional dependencies:

  * libcld2-dev ("Compact Language Detector 2" for better language autodetection and non-English source languages)
  * C++REST SDK >= 2.5 (Crowdin integration)


 Unix
------

Do the usual thing:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You must have the dependencies installed in a location configure will find,
e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS appropriately.


 macOS
-------

You need a full git checkout to build on macOS; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.xcworkspace workspace and Xcode 6 to build
Poedit.

There are some additional dependencies on tools not included with macOS.
They can be installed with Homebrew and macos/Brewfile:

    brew bundle --file=macos/Brewfile


 Windows using Visual Studio 2015
----------------------------------

You need a full git checkout to build on Windows; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.sln solution to build everything.

To build the installer, open win32/poedit.iss in Inno Setup and compile the
project.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

Get the sources from github (https://github.com/vslavik/poedit):

    git clone https://github.com/vslavik/poedit.git

If you are on Windows or OSX, you'll need all the dependencies too. After
closing, run the following command:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

On Linux and other Unices, only a subset of submodules is necessary, so you can
save some time and disk space by checking out only them:

    git submodule update --init deps/json deps/pugixml

When building for Unix/Linux, if you get the sources directly from the Git
repository, some generated files are not present. You have to run the
./bootstrap script to create them. After that, continue according to the
instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * gettext tools to create .mo files

On macOS and Windows, bootstrapping is not needed.


 License
=========

Poedit is released under the MIT license and you're free to do 
whatever you want with it and its source code (well, almost :-) -- see the
license text).

icons/README file for details on the icons.
