                      a cross-platform translation editor


 About
=======

A simple translation editor for PO and XLIFF files.

It also serves as a GUI frontend to more GNU gettext utilities (win32 version
is part of the distribution) and catalogs editor/source code parser.

Uses
=======
With Poedit you can help translating applications into other language. For details on principles
of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or wxWidgets' wxLocale class reference.


 Installing
============

Easily-installable prebuilt binaries for Windows and macOS are available from
https://poedit.net/download.

Official binaries for Linux are available as a Snap package at https://snapcraft.io/poedit
Most Linux|GNU distributions also include native Poedit packages.


 Installing from sources
=========================

Requirements:

  * Boost
  * Unicode build of the [wxWidgets library](https://www.wxwidgets.org), version >= 3.0.3
  * ICU
  * LucenePlusPlus
  * If on Unix, GtkSpell for spellchecking support

Optional dependencies:

  * cld2 (better language autodetection and non-English source languages)
  * C++REST SDK >= 2.5 (Crowdin integration)


 Unix
------

Do the usual:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You must have the dependencies installed in a location where the configure script will find
them, e.g. by setting CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS appropriately.


 macOS
-------

You need a full Git checkout to build on macOS; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.xcworkspace workspace and the latest version of
Xcode to build Poedit.

There are some additional dependencies on tools not included with macOS.
They can be installed with Homebrew and macos/Brewfile:

    brew bundle --file=macos/Brewfile

 Windows, using Visual Studio 2017
----------------------------------

You need a full Git checkout to build on Windows; see below for details.

After checkout, use the Poedit.sln solution to build everything.

To build the installer, open win32/poedit.iss in [Inno Setup](https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc) and compile the
project.


 Installing from Git repository
--------------------------------

Get the sources from GitHub (https://github.com/vslavik/poedit):


    git clone https://github.com/vslavik/poedit.git


If you are on Windows or macOS, you'll need all the dependencies too.
After cloning the repository, run this command:


    git submodule update --init --recursive


On Linux|GNU and other Unices, only a subset of submodules is necessary, so you can
save some time and disk space by checking out only them:


    git submodule update --init deps/json deps/pugixml


When building for Unix/Linux, if you get the sources directly from the Git
repository, some generated files are not present. You have to run the
./bootstrap script to create them. After that, continue according to the
instructions above.

The ./bootstrap script requires some additional tools to be installed:

 * AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmlto to generate the manual page
 * GNU gettext tools to create .mo files

On macOS and Windows, bootstrapping is not needed.
