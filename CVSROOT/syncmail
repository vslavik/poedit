"""Complicated notification for CVS checkins.

This script is used to provide email notifications of changes to the CVS
repository.  These email changes will include context diffs of the changes.
Really big diffs will be trimmed.

This script is run from a CVS loginfo file (see $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/loginfo).  To
set this up, create a loginfo entry that looks something like this:

    mymodule /path/to/this/script %%s some-email-addr@your.domain

In this example, whenever a checkin that matches `mymodule' is made, this
script is invoked, which will generate the diff containing email, and send it
to some-email-addr@your.domain.

    Note: This module used to also do repository synchronizations via
    rsync-over-ssh, but since the repository has been moved to SourceForge,
    this is no longer necessary.  The syncing functionality has been ripped
    out in the 3.0, which simplifies it considerably.  Access the 2.x versions
    to refer to this functionality.  Because of this, the script is misnamed.

It no longer makes sense to run this script from the command line.  Doing so
will only print out this usage information.

Usage:

    %(PROGRAM)s [options] <%%S> email-addr [email-addr ...]

Where options is:

    --cvsroot=<path>
    	Use <path> as the environment variable CVSROOT.  Otherwise this
    	variable must exist in the environment.

    --help
    -h
        Print this text.

    --context=#
    -C #
        Include # lines of context around lines that differ (default: 2).

    -c
        Produce a context diff (default).

    -u
        Produce a unified diff (smaller, but harder to read).

    <%%S>
        CVS %%s loginfo expansion.  When invoked by CVS, this will be a single
        string containing the directory the checkin is being made in, relative
        to $CVSROOT, followed by the list of files that are changing.  If the
        %%s in the loginfo file is %%{sVv}, context diffs for each of the
        modified files are included in any email messages that are generated.

    email-addrs
        At least one email address.
