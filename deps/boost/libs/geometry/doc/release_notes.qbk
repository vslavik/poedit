[section:release_notes Release Notes]

[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.58]
[/=================]

[*Additional functionality]

* New algorithm num_segments, returning the number of segments of a geometry
* New overload for is_valid algorithm, that takes a string reference as a second argument and fills it with a message related to the validity or invalidity of the geometry

* Disjoint and intersects support the following geometry combinations: point/multipoint, multipoint/multipoint, multipoint/segment, multipoint/box

[*Improvements]

* Buffer now supports flat-ends for linestrings with a bend close to the start (such that buffered segment crosses flat-end).
* Buffer performance is improved significantly
* Partition performance is improved significantly for polygons, potentially enhancing all overlay operations

[*Bugfixes]

* Bug in multipoint/polygon multipoint/multipolygon distance computation (wrong detection of points inside the areal geometry)
* Bug in flatten_iterator's assignment operator causing an access violation 
* Bug in Cartesian segment-segment intersection strategy when one segment degenerates to a point and is collinear to the other non-degenerate segment
* Bug in centroid(), non-deterministic result if calculated for e.g. a Polygon with zero-area.

* Use consistent side information in cart_intersect and get_turn_info and handle_tangencies and enrich_intersection_info. This
  is done by switching to integer (if necessary) for the specific 6 points only, zooming in on the 4 or 3 segments

[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.54]
[/=================]

[*Additional functionality]

* added Spatial Index, developed for Boost.Geometry by Adam Wulkiewicz. The spatial index was originally started by Federico J. Fernandez during the Google Summer of Code 2008 program, mentored by Hartmut Kaiser.
* added SVG-output, this was already in extensions for several years

[*Documentation]

* small fixes of missing words
* fixes in doc of template parameters (convex_hull, exterior_ring, return_buffer)

[*Bugfixes]

[*Solved tickets]

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7462 7462] degenerate union result for float, fixed

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8405 8405] silenced compiler warning C4189: '...' : local variable is initialized but not referenced

[*Internal changes]

* Made several algorithms variant-aware (append, area, clear, convert, equals, length, num_points)


[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.53]
[/=================]

[*Bugfixes]

* avoid generating output polygons with interior rings below minimum size (e.g. one or two points)
* `geometry::disjoint` for degenerate segments (patched by Karsten Ahnert)
* problem in `geometry::difference` for missing handling tangency, reported by H2
* fixed `geometry::for_each` for use with Lambda's
* fixed `geometry::comparable_distance` point-linestring (and -range, -polygon)

[*Additional functionality]

* combinations for `geometry::disjoint`: point/ring, point/polygon, point/multi_polygon
* combinations for `geometry::intersects`: point/ring, point/polygon, point/multi_polygon

[*Internal changes]

* updates in specializations/not_implemented for various algorithms (as in an earlier version, these changes are still going on; they take care for simplified structs, better error reporting, and automatized documentation)
* fixes in unit tests

[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.51]
[/=================]

[*Breaking changes]

* points accessed through a pointer (e.g. in a linestring) should now be specialized without the pointer. In previous versions a type `my_point` used like `linestring<my_point*>` had to be specalized like: `template<> struct tag<my_point*>`. Now the library itself removes the pointer before calling the traits class, so now it should be like: `template<> struct tag<my_point>`

[*Bugfixes]

* intersection was sometimes wrong for integer points, fixed
* documentation, order of parameters in simplify was wrong, fixed

[*Solved tickets]

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7030 7030] spherical distance, fixed (by patch of Karsten Ahnert)


[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.50]
[/=================]

[*Bugfixes]

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6166 6166] patch for missing transformation, applied
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6696 6696] invalid intersection output, was (by chance) already fixed in Trunk before reported

[*Additional functionality]

* added algorithm "touches" (OGC SF compliant) for *polygon/*polygon

[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.49]
[/=================]

[*Breaking changes]

* point_xy was accidentally included in one of the headerfiles. If the point_xy class is used, it should be included explicitly now.

[*Bugfixes]

* bugfix: distance for multi-geometries ignored specified distance strategy. Fixed
* bugfix: difference for polygon/multi_polygon (reported 2011/10/24 on GGL-list)
* bugfix: raise exception for calculation of distances of multi-geometrie(s) where one of them is empty

* bugfix: self-intersections could sometimes be missed (introduced in 1.48), fixed
* bugfix: convex hull crashed on empty range (e.g. empty multi point), fixed

* bugfix: disjoint/intersect did not work for degenerate linestrings. Fixed.

[*Solved tickets]

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6019 6019] convex_hull / area, fixed.
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6021 6021] convex_hull / append (multipoint), fixed.
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6028 6028] Documentation: closure, fixed.
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6178 6178] Missing headerfile, fixed.

[*Additional functionality]

* support for line/polygon intersections and differences
* support for convert of segment/box of different point types
* support for append for multi point
* the scalar function distance now throws an empty_input_exception on empty input

[*Documentation]

* updated support status in several algorithms
* updated conformance to OGC or std
* other updates and fixes

[*Internal changes]

* updates in specializations/not_implemented for distance/convert/assign/area/with/covered_by
* move of wkt/dsv to io folder, making domains redundant
* warnings: strategy concepts assigned to zero to avoid clang warnings (patched by Vishnu)
* warnings: there were several unused parameters, for which gcc/clang warned (patched by Christophe)

[/=================]
[heading Boost 1.48]
[/=================]

[*Bugfixes]

* Robustness issue, in some circumstances the union failed to output. Fixed.
* Robustness issue, in some circumstances the calculated intersection point was outside the segment. Fixed.
* Concept issue, cartesian intersect didn't understand segments other than the provided one. Fixed.
* Sometimes self-intersections in linestrings were missed. Fixed.
* The fusion coordinate system was not registered correctly. Fixed.

[*Solved tickets]

* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5726 5726] Segment intersection algorithm still assumes 'first', 'second' members
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5744 5744] Mistake in fusion adapt example
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5748 5748] Needed to include <boost/foreach.hpp>
* [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5954 5954] distance_pythagoras skips sqrt() step

[*Improvements on algorithms]

* Checking self-intersections is now not done automatically, this can blast performance.
* Besides that, checking self-intersections is made faster.
* Intersections now avoid outputting duplicate points. So they output the minimal set.

[*Additional algorithms]

* covered_by: within is defined as "within, not on boundary". covered_by is "within or on boundary"

[*Additional functionality]

* within: strategies can now be specified for within<point, box> and within<box, box>
* convert: a much broader range of conversions is supported
* assign: idem, (currently partly) synonym for convert (but reversed arguments)

[*Additional coordinate types]

* Basic (limited) support for Boost.Rational
