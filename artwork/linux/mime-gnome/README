The template.* files come frome gnome-theme-icon-2.22 and are under GPL
(whatever that means for icon files, exactly...).

All other icons are based on these templates, they just add overlay on top
of the template, and so they too fall under GPL. The overlays themselves
(without template.* background) are under the same terms as the rest of
Poedit.
